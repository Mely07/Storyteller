# Storyteller

## <a href="https://youtu.be/ip-35dBWi04" target="_blank">Demo</a>

Storyteller is a single page story-building application built using CSS, Javascript, React and Redux libraries on the frontend and a Ruby on Rails built API backend. A user posts an opening line to a story alongside an image and subsequent users can then comment or add context to the story. With each new post, the storyâ€™s narrative is redirected in whichever way the new author chooses. Storyteller encourages creativity and collaboration and can be used as a learning tool for students enrolled in remote learning.
